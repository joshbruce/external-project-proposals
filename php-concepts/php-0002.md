Help wanted: RFC submission and implementation.

As of this writing I do not believe I have the [karma points](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/howto) (step 2) required to submit an RFC myself.

As of this writing I do not have the knowledge, practice, and practical understanding of implementing within PHP internals to implement this myself. If you're interested in (helping) implement this concept, please do reach out (help may be in the form guidance and instruction or full implementation, up to you).

(After the RFC process and clearly defining what's being done.)

**Perceived roadblocks**

None

**Known questions and concerns still outstanding:**

- Should `empty()` be treated differently than being cast as a `bool`, and why?
  - I have a personal use case for wanting them to be potentially different, but that's only one use case.
- Would it be more universally appropriate to have a way to define an object "as empty" - does this already exist?
- Does the rationale section add value? (Removed for now, if you've read before and don't miss it, question answered.)
- ~What to name the interface(s) as it (they) does (do) not fit the *-able pattern well.~
- ~The drawbacks and potential complexity (or adding bugs) in implementing the cast capability.~
- ~Whether to use magic method only, interface only, or both (as of now, we are going with both to increase the potential for future consistency based on what is in PHP 8, and RFCs under review).~
- ~Rumors of magic methods going away - not from folks in the deep end of PHP development near as I can tell.~

Please feel free to add more.

# Create functional interface so objects may declare emptiness and by extension truthiness

This [concept] introduces a way to represent an empty value object without using `null` by introducing a new `Emptiable` interface with `isEmpty()` method.

This [concept] has # goals:

1. provide a way to represent an instantiated, albeit "empty" and "false" object, without using `null` that is consistent with similar approaches seen in `Countable` and `Stringable`.[^1]
2. provide an `Emptiable` functional interface allowing binary result for `empty()` and cast to `bool`, and
3. ~allow `bool|Emptiable` to express `bool|object-with-isEmpty()`, and~
3. no BC breaks (no polyfill is planned at this time).

## Introduction

Goal 1: For scalar types, emptiness appears directly tied to truthiness. For compound types the behavior appears limited and inconsistent.

The following demonstrations use one scalar type (string) and one compound type (array) to illustrate the difference when it comes to objects (other scalar and compound types are in the Demonstrations section).

```php
// String
$bool = empty("Hello"); // false

$bool = empty(""); // true

$bool = (bool) "Hello"; // true

$bool = (bool) ""; // false

// Array
$bool = empty([1, 2, 3]); // false

$bool = empty([]); // true

$bool = (bool) [1, 2, 3]; // true

$bool = (bool) []; // false

if ([1, 2, 3]) {} // true

if (! []) {} // true

// Object
$bool = empty(new \stdClass()); // false

$bool = (bool) new \stdClass(); // true

if (new \stdClass()) {} // true

if (! new \stdClass()) {} // false

// There is no "false" variant for an object instance - only null.

// Null
$bool = empty(null); // true

$bool = (bool) null; // false

if (null) {} // false - which makes sense as null is a singlular type, the ultimate empty and false.
```

The way developers approximate an empty object is by using a different type, which represent absolutely nothing, `null`. Workarounds (hacks) are possible by way of the `Countable` and `Stringable` interfaces.

```php
class MyClass implements Countable
{
  public function __toString()
  {
    return "";
  }

  public function count()
  {
    return 0;
  }
}

$instance = new MyClass();

$bool = empty((string) $instance); // true

$bool = empty(count($instance)); // true

$bool = (bool) count($instance); // false
```

This is not a very elegant solution.

When it comes to `null` it's generally recommended that it be avoided whenever possible, reserving `null` for the "ultimate empty or false." 

With most scalar types and the `array` compound type developers can maintain type safety by returning the empty variant of the given type, without the need for nullable types (optionals - PHP 7.1) or union types (PHP 8.0) that might also return `null`.[^2]

```php
class MyClass
{
  public function aFunction($return = true): string
  {
    if ($return) {
      return "Hello, World!";
    }
    return "";
  }

  public function bFunction($return = true): array
  {
    if ($return) {
      return [1, 2, 3];
    }
    return [];
  }
}
```

Again, there is no way to represent a valid instance of an object (type) that happens to be empty, except to return a different type, `null`, which is not technically accurate. The need to return "empty" objects partially necessitates the presence of optionals and union types as language features.

Goal 2: To maintain consistency and feel similar to what's available in PHP, this [concept] follows the `Countable` interface and implementation, as such the interface will need to be part of the class declaration. 

(Unless we want this rationale to apply to instances of `stdClass()`, which would be more like `Stringable` with dynamic declaration at compile time. If that's the case, `isEmpty()` should probably be a magic method to avoid possible name collisions. While simultaneously opening the door to those using such a method to declare the interface and remove direct calls to the method.)

The interface stub.

```php
interface Emptiable
{
  public function isEmpty(): bool;
}
```

Goal 3: As this is a new language feature and requires declaring the interface explicity ~PHP guidance reserves method or function names preceded by two underscores~, there should be no backward compatibility issues or concerns. 

## Usage

As of today, the following sample only checks if the class was successfully instantiated, not if the instance considers itself "non-empty".

```php
class MyClass
{}

$instance = new MyClass();
if ($instance) {
  // Not null - reached so long as an instance is generated

} else {
  // Is null

}
```

This similar sample, is checking if the instance believe itself to be in a `true` or `false` state.

```php
class MyClass implements Emptiable
{
  public function isEmpty(): bool
  {
    return false;
  }
}

$instance = new MyClass();

$bool = empty($instance); // true

$bool = (bool) $instance; // false

if ($instance) {
  // Not true - according to the instance - not reached

} elseif (! $instance) {
  // Handle false - would be reached

}

// Declaring variable in condition
if (! $i = new MyClass()) {
  // Should be reached - not possible at present

} elseif ($i = new MyClass()) {
  // Always reached as long as instantiation too place

}
```

Applying the Not operator would:

1. check if not `null` AND cast-able to bool, cast the return value to `bool` (otherwise, exit conditional)
2. if `false` the return value is assigned to `$i`.

This could be useful when triggering errors and similar guard operations while simultaneously reducing syntactic boilerplate.

## Demonstrations

Demonstrating internal consisting of scalar types.

```php
// Integer
$bool = empty(1); // false

$bool = empty(-1); // false

$bool = empty(0); // true

$bool = (bool) 1; // true

$bool = (bool) -1; // true

$bool = (bool) 0; // false

// Float
$bool = empty(0.1); // false

$bool = empty(-0.1); // false

$bool = empty(0.0); // true

$bool = (bool) 0.1; // true

$bool = (bool) -0.1; // true

$bool = (bool) 0.0; // false
```
